# Python3 Drawing Algorithms

## Overview
This repository contains two projects that use Python's `turtle` module to create graphical representations of colorful patterns. These projects were developed as solutions to competition tasks in the field of Computer Science for Polish children.

## Projects
1. **Dywan i Żółw (Carpet and Turtle)**
   - **File**: `Dywan i żółw.py`
   - **Description**: This project creates a colorful pattern resembling a carpet with red rectangles and green arrows, utilizing Python classes and decorators.
   - **Author**: Tomasz Nehring

2. **Mozaika (Mosaic)**
   - **File**: `Mozaika.py`
   - **Description**: This project creates a colorful mosaic pattern with green and yellow squares, using various functions and decorators.
   - **Author**: Tomasz Nehring

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `turtle` module (usually included with Python's standard library)

## Instructions
### Dywan i Żółw (Carpet and Turtle)
1. **Setup**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. **Run**: Execute the `Dywan i żółw.py` script to see the pattern being drawn.
3. **Exit**: Close the window or click to exit the turtle graphics screen.

### Mozaika (Mosaic)
1. **Setup**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. **Run**: Execute the `Mozaika.py` script to see the mosaic pattern being drawn.
3. **Exit**: Close the window or click to exit the turtle graphics screen.

## Features
### Dywan i Żółw (Carpet and Turtle)
- Draws a colorful pattern with red rectangles and green arrows.
- Utilizes Python classes and decorators to manage drawing procedures.
- Continuous rotation of a turtle shape at the center.

### Mozaika (Mosaic)
- Draws a colorful mosaic pattern with green and yellow squares.
- Utilizes Python decorators to manage drawing procedures.
- Customizable mosaic size and pattern density.

## Project Aim
Both algorithms are solutions to competition tasks in the field of Computer Science for Polish children.
